For testing the batchmake module, we have aimed for very few external dependencies.

BatchMake and Condor binaries are not required.

What is required is that the the midas tmp dir (usually $MIDAS_ROOT/tmp/misc) is
writable by the user who is running tests.

One brute force way to accomplish this is

sudo chmod -R 777 $MIDAS_ROOT/tmp/misc
